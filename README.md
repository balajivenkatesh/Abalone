# Abalone
Android App for the 2 player board game Abalone ([Abalone wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game)))

Screenshots below.

**Quick inspiration backstory:**

My friends and I found an abandonded box of the actual board game in our college dorm. We learnt the game from the instrucions in the box and played quite a bit.

The game seemed to work similar mental muscles as chess.

I saw an (and still think there is) an opporuntiy to <ins>build a online multiplayer community around this game</ins>.

I have never heard of the game before or after that (disclaimer: I haven't even read the wiki link I just added for context).
